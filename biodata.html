            üìå My name is <b>Ajirah Binti Abd Hamid</b>. The name <em>"Ajirah"</em> is very special to me, given by my late father. I was born on <strong>24th February 2004</strong> at Hospital Plaza Medical Center in Kajang, Selangor. I currently live in <strong>Bandar Tun Hussein Onn</strong> in Cheras. 
            I have 6 siblings and I am the fifth child. In addition, I have a twin. My twin, Athirah, is the older sister. Despite being an introvert, I have a curiosity to try new things.

            My hobbies include spending time with my family watching movies, especially series like The Maze Runner and Harry Potter. Lately, I've developed an interest in cycling. During the semester break, I went cycling at the Wetland Park in Putrajaya and in Sekinchan.
            I can feel peace while cycling while enjoying nature.

            Apart from exploring Malaysia, I have been to Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. These vacations with my family are filled with great memories. Among these three countries, an interesting experience is a holiday in Indonesia. The thing I can't forget in Indonesia is that I was able to go to Safari Bogor Indonesia Park. I think it's really fun to see animal life up close.
            Not only that,
            My parents were scammed by an aunt who sold a large luggage bag but the quality was easy to tear and my parents wore it for less than a day. However, when vacationing in people's countries, I was able to learn from my own eyes the differences in culture, various food dishes and the atmosphere in people's countries are very different.
            <br>
            Looking forward, I plan to visit places like Mecca for Umrah with my family. Other than that, Japan is another my dream destination, especially Universal Studios Japan and Niseko in Hokkaido that renowned for its snow sports.

            During the COVID-19 period, I helped my sister with her dessert business, including tarts, birthday cakes, and holiday treats. I managed her Instagram account, creating promotional posters. It was fulfilling to balance business activities with my studies.

            I miss my school days at SMK Bandar Tun Hussein Onn (2), just 7 minutes away by foot. I fondly remember my time in Form 5, during SPM, when I met incredible teachers. My favorite subject was History, and I always aimed for an A in that subject.
             After school, I‚Äôd often walk with friends and grab drinks or snacks from roadside shops.
            <br>
            After graduating, I continued my studies at Universiti Teknologi MARA in the Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau campus. I'm currently in my 5th semester, pursuing a diploma in Information Science. At university, I actively participate in band association activities and serve as the secretary.
