            Hospital Plaza Medical Center in Kajang, Selangor. I currently live in <strong> Bandar Tun Hussein Onn </strong>
            in the Cheras area. I have 6 siblings and I am the fifth child. Not only that, I have a <i>twin</i> named Athirah 
            and she is the older sister while I am the younger sister. My attitude is that of an introvert but with a desire 
            to try something new. Furthermore, the name <em>"Ajirah" </em> is very unique and special to me and the name was given by my late father.</font>

                I am currently in my 5th semester and majoring in a diploma in Pusat pengajian Sains Maklumat. While at university, I was active in band association activities and held the position of secretary.</font>

            My favorite movie is that I love to watch movie series like the maze runner and Harry Potter. 
            Then, my latest hobby is now I like to ride a bike. During the semester break after industrial 
            training I went to ride a bike at the Wetland park in Putrajaya and in Sekinchan.</font>

                is that I have been on vacation to Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. I have many memories with the people I love, my family.
                
            Other than that, I want to share about the list of places I want to visit with my family.
            The first is, I want to go to perform Umrah with my family. Of course, this place is the main destination
            for Muslims. Next, the second destination I want to go to is Japan. In Japan, I want to go to Universal 
            Studio of Japan. There are many theme park challenges that I want to explore! .
            Not only that, I want to go visit Nara Park where there are deer animals where they only enter for free!

            During the covid 19 period, I helped my sister in the dessert business such as tarts, birthday cakes and 
            holiday cakes as well as lasagna and Mac n Cheese. My job was to make posters for promotions and I hold an 
            Instagram account to always update about my sister's business. To be honest, I feel happy because I can fill my free time to do 
            business at the same time I study.
