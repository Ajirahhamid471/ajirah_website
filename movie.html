    Yi Yao is a withdrawn high school girl living with an abusive mother, who runs a sensual massage parlor and is ashamed of her daughter. 
    Qi Ming is Yi's childhood friend, who was brought up in poverty and the role model at school. Yi is bullied mercilessly at school by Tang Xiaomi and her friends. 
    Her only friends are Gu Sunxi and his twin sister Sunxiang. Everyone's personal lives conflict and things only go from bad to worse.

    For anyone out there who is suffering the same fate as Yi Yao, I hope you don't give up on life because life has so much to offer once you get through the unfortunate events. 
    Find someone you can rely on; if you can't, seek a therapist. Please don't let the bad side of life consume you, please. To bullies, I really have no idea why you have to bully someone. 
    I can't say anything because I really have no idea what's on your mind to bully someone.

                their family; it emphasizes the importance of embracing imperfections, supporting one another, and recognizing that
