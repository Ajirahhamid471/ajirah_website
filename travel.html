        Hokkaido is most famous, among foreign travelers, for the ski fields of Niseko. Other attractions, experiences and products people might know include the Hakodate night view, Asahiyama Zoo, 
        lavender fields of Furano, Sapporo Beer and the culture of the indigenous Ainu people.
        It offers the draw of adventure travel with spectacular seasonal views set against the backdrop of its majestic natural environment, including outdoor activities such as skiing and trekking, unique culture such as the tradition of the indigenous Ainu people and the Jomon culture, myriad gourmet options, and hot springs.
        Hokkaido attracts many visitors not only from Japan, but also from abroad.

  <br><p><font size="3" color="#17202a" face="Georgia (serif)"><em>Niseko („Éã„Çª„Ç≥) </em>is the most famous ski resort in Japan, known for having tons of light powder snow, spectacular backcountry and a large number of foreigners - especially Australians - who in recent decades have been responsible for 
  popularizing the resort area with the skiing and snowboarding community outside of Japan. As a result, Niseko's resorts are very accessible and welcoming to foreign visitors, which they keep busy with plenty of vast, long ski runs, endless powder, and a growing number of after-ski activities.
  In addition to kilometers of ski trails, many of Niseko's resorts offer winter adventure seekers the option to explore off trail skiing, a relatively uncommon attraction at most other ski resorts in Japan. The backcountry can be accessed through special gates around the resorts or experienced 
  on guided tours and helicopter tours. The latter is also possible on nearby Mount Yotei, a nearly perfect volcanic cone, which can be seen from Niseko.

Situated along the Sorachi River, Furano belongs to Furano-Ashibetsu Nature Park. Because of its position in the heart of Hokkaido , Furano is nicknamed the "navel town." There's even a festival to celebrate it.
  In winter, Furano is prime downhill and cross-country skiing territory with world-class slopes. Warmer weather is perfect for river rafting, trekking, cycling, golf and other pursuits.

    <li>Oval in shape, <b>Jeju Island measures 40 miles (64 km) from east to west and 16 miles (26 km) from north to south</b>.
